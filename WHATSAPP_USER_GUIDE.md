## FAQ

### Q: Do I need a developer account?
**A:** No! This is a one-click connection. No technical knowledge needed.

### Q: Do I need to copy any tokens or codes?
**A:** No! Everything is handled automatically. Just log in and authorize.

### Q: What if I don't have a WhatsApp Business Account?
**A:** That's okay! During the connection flow, Facebook will guide you to create one. Alternatively, you can create one first at [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com).

### Q: Can I use my personal WhatsApp number?
**A:** No, you need a WhatsApp Business Account. This is different from personal WhatsApp and designed for businesses to communicate with customers.

### Q: What if I already use WhatsApp Business API with another tool?
**A:** You can connect the same WhatsApp Business Account to multiple tools! Just go through the connection flow and select your existing account.

### Q: How long does the connection last?
